# Multiple selectors:
-> applies same property to the selectors
-> syntax:
    selector1, selector2{
        ...
    }

-> example:
    h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6{
        font-family: "Arial"
    }

# Hierarchical selectors:
-> get to the specific child by using the parent element
-> read from right to left
-> syntax:
    selector1 selector2{
        ...
    }
    or
    parent child{
        ...
    }
-> example:
    .container-fluid #title{
        color: red;
    }

# Combined selectors:
-> simply combine selectors
-> no space between the selectors
-> selectors have to occur inside same element
-> read from left to right
-> syntax:
    selector1.selector2{
        ...
    }
    or
     selector1#selector2{
        ...
    }
-> example:
    h1#title{color: red;}
    div.container-fluid{color: red;}    # div with class named container-fluid should have the color red
